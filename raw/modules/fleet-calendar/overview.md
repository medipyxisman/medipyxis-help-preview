# Fleet Calendar overview

The Fleet Calendar is the multi-provider scheduling and routing surface that shows every appointment across your facility in one view, organized by provider and day.

*Fleet Calendar — Day view. Each horizontal lane represents one provider; appointment cards are color-coded by status.*

## Views

| View | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Day** | Swim lanes per provider for a single date. Best for daily dispatch. |
| **Week** | Seven-day grid for all providers. Best for planning coverage gaps. |
| **Month** | High-level count tiles per day. Best for spotting density patterns. |

Switch views using the **Day / Week / Month** toggle in the top-right of the calendar.

## Appointment status colors

Every appointment card carries one of nine status colors, which update as the visit progresses.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Scheduled** | Booked, not yet started. |
| **Draft Saved** | Appointment form saved but not confirmed. |
| **Progress Note In Progress** | Clinician has started the Visit Wizard. |
| **Seen** | Visit documentation is underway. |
| **Visit Completed** | Visit Wizard signed and locked. |
| **Rescheduled** | Original slot replaced; a new appointment exists. |
| **Canceled** | Appointment voided — no replacement created. |
| **No Show** | Patient did not answer or was unavailable at the door. |
| **Not Seen** | Clinician arrived but could not complete the visit. |

## Relationship to Referral Intake

When a referral card moves into the **Assigned** column in Referral Intake, it becomes eligible for scheduling in the Fleet Calendar. Select the patient when creating an appointment — the referral data pre-populates the **Appointment Type** and provider fields.
