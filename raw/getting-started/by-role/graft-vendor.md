# Graft vendor first hour

By the end of this hour you will have received a purchase order, confirmed a shipment against a lot, uploaded the invoice, and seen your reconciliation status. The vendor portal is read-mostly — your main job is to keep shipments and lot data accurate.

## Before you start

- The practice has invited you via email. Click the link and set your password.
- You know your product SKUs, LOT numbers, and unit pricing.

## Step 1 — Sign in and pick your vendor (3 min)

1. `https://app.medipyxis.com/vendor-portal`, sign in.
2. If you supply more than one Medipyxis practice, the **Vendor Selector** at the top-right lets you switch.

## Step 2 — See open POs (5 min)

1. **Purchase Orders** tab. Columns: PO number, practice, order date, expected ship date, status (*Open*, *Partial*, *Shipped*, *Received*, *Reconciled*).
2. Click any PO to see line items: SKU, quantity ordered, unit cost, required LOT expiration range.

## Step 3 — Ship against a PO (10 min)

1. From an open PO, click **Confirm Shipment**.
2. For each line item, enter:
   - **LOT number** (required)
   - **Expiration date** (required)
   - **Shipped quantity** (may be less than ordered for partial ships)
   - **Tracking number** (optional but recommended)
3. Click **Submit shipment**. The practice's **Receiving** queue is notified.

<Warning>
LOT expiration dates must be **after** the earliest scheduled visit that uses the product. If not, the PO is flagged and the practice will reject receiving.
</Warning>

## Step 4 — Upload invoice (5 min)

1. **Invoices** tab → **+ New invoice**. Pick the PO, attach the PDF, enter invoice number and amount.
2. Medipyxis auto-matches your invoice lines to the PO lines. Any mismatches surface in **Disputes** for you and the practice AP team to resolve.

## Step 5 — Watch reconciliation status (2 min)

Your dashboard tile **Reconciled $** shows lifetime and month-to-date paid vs. shipped. Anything in **Dispute** is your work-in-progress — click a row to see the AP note and respond.

## Step 6 — Handle a reorder request (5 min)

When the practice's PAR level trips for one of your products, you'll see a **Reorder Request** in the portal.

1. Open it, confirm quantity and delivery date, click **Accept**.
2. A new PO is created automatically — you're back at Step 2 above.

## Result

- You've shipped one PO with accurate LOT + expiration data.
- Your invoice is matched and in flight to payment.
- You know where reorder requests appear.
